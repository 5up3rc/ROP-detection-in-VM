# ROP-detection-in-VM

This is derived from a malware detection project from our lab.

Shortly, I build a kBouncer to Xen for detecting ROP attack in guest-VMs using Intel LBR.

Usage:

After make and make install, you (the clould provider) can use the commands in directory which contains some LibVMI-based programs and an alert program.
